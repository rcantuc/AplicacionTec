# README

Although knowledge of Python, R, or Matlab was preferred, I am still answering the questions based on my expertise. My main programming background is in Stata. Nonetheless, I also have knowledge of Python, R, HTML, and PHP.

I used GitHub Copilot to convert my Stata code into Python. Although not all scripts currently work, I believe I can eventually get them to work with enough time.

Each question has been answered in its own file. To run them, you need to execute them in order from first to last, ensuring that you change the working directory as needed.

There are a few points to note:

- I did not answer questions 4 and 5; however, I left some markdown comments for them.
- I am not very familiar with climate change databases.
- No inferences can be made with the current results of the model.
- Given enough time, I could further clean the dataset and execute the files seamlessly.
